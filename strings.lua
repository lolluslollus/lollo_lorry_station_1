				A modular lorry station with one single terminal.
				You can combine several of these stations to make a complex lorry station, with full control on the paths and the capacities.
				
				To place one, make the streets first and leave some empty space for the station.

				This mod requires the street fine tuning. It provides extra straat types, junctions and a slicer tool to avoid destroying too many buildings.
				At the current state of the game, I could not find a way to make this station entirely non-destructive: if you have buildings around, some will have to go.

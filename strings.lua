				A modular lorry station with one single terminal.

				You can combine several of these to make a complex lorry station, with full control on the paths and the capacities. You can also combine them with the stock streetside stations, used as unload-only points for your hub.
				
				To place one, make the streets first and leave some empty space for the station, which comes with its own piece of road attached. Best: make the streets with no gaps and help yourself with the slicer, you will find it in the street construction menu if you install the street fine tuning.
                
				You can use the pavement to store cargo or leave it clear for pedestrians.
                
				TIPS AND TRICKS
				Placing two stations close to each other can be a pain, because the game tries to snap things together, fails and raises pointless error messages. Add some extra length to get past this, or leave a broader gap between your stations.

				Install the street fine tuning to have useful building tools and more roads.

				If you want to force something into a station catchment area, use the ultrathin paths.

				Use the categories in the street menu so you don't go bananas selecting road types.

				You can use modded street types, as long as they have one of the following categories: country, highway, one-way, urban, mining.

				If you attempt to configure your station and see collision warnings, make sure the right street type is selected in the configuration menu. It is a dynamic selection and it can do that, it's only cosmetic.
				
				If you are not happy with a street mod, remove or reconfigure the modular lorry stations that use it, remove or replace all the modded streets, quit the game and reload it without the offending mod.

				WORD OF WARNING
				The first iteration of this mod had an awkward grid. If you have already built some of these stations, they will keep working. As soon as you configure them, the old modules will go away and you will have to plop the new ones instead. It is a one-off and a small price to pay for a decidedly better grid.

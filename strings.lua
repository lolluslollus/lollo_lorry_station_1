				A modular lorry station with one single terminal.

				You can combine several of these to make a complex lorry station, with full control on the paths and the capacities.
				
				To place one, make the streets first and leave some empty space for the station, which comes with its own piece of road attached. Help yourself with the slicer, you will find it in the street construction menu if you install the street fine tuning.
                
				You can use the pavement to store cargo or leave it clear for pedestrians.
                
				TIPS AND TRICKS
				If you want to force something into a station catchment area, use the ultrathin paths.
				
				Install the street fine tuning to have useful building tools and more roads.

				Use the categories in the street menu so you don't go bananas selecting road types.

				WORD OF WARNING
				The first iteration of this mod had an awkward grid. If you have already built some of these stations, they will keep working. As soon as you configure them, the old modules will go away and you will have to plop the new ones instead. It is a one-off and a small price to pay for a decidedly better grid.
